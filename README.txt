This program is used to search for your favorite movie, or maybe one you're interested in and return the IMDb score so you can have a good idea going into it if you are going to watch a good movie or a potentially bad one. It doesn't seem very fancy or particularly special but getting this to work took weeks, so I hope you have fun navigating it!

./movie_app is what you will use to initiate the search, follow the prompts from there !
